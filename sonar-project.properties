# Exclude specific files/directories from SonarCloud coverage analysis
# This prevents "0% coverage on new code" errors for files that are not unit tested
sonar.coverage.exclusions=app/api/**/*,hooks/**/*,lib/**/*,components/**/*,app/components/**/*,app/layout.tsx,app/page.tsx,**/*.mjs

# Note: Ideally, you should write tests for these files instead of excluding them.
